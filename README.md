# Daily Journal App

This is a journalling app made by me, in Java, to essentially replace Daylio on my phone.  This is being worked on in my spare time. To be finished at the end of December 2024. This is also built entirely in BlueJ until I'm forced to leave it.

The app will:

- [ ] One journel entry per day. Either image based or text. Not sure. Likely will be an image thing.

- [ ] Track mood

- [ ] Track activities

- [ ] Upto 5 photos per day

- [ ] Misc stats
